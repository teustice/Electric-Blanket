## Description



## Program Specifications

  - User can navigate a rendered grid of squares using the arrow keys.
  - Whenever the user releases a/all keys, they are returned to the center position.
  - Whenever the user presses a key a rhythm is played. The key of that rhythm is determined by the users position in the grid.
    - **Example Input:** "left-arrow" , grid position: [0,1]
    - **Example Output:** key played: C#
  - If the user presses two keys next to one another, they are positioned in the diagonal space between the two pressed keys.
  - If the user presses two keys in opposite directions, only the most recent key will be played.
  - The program will only respond to the arrow keys, no other keys will be registered.
